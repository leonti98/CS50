With this information, we can hypothesize that the
listener is energetic and loves dancing.
However, the positiveness of songs is less than
an average of 0.5 on Spotify, leading to unexpected result.

A better way to determine the aura of the listener would be
to calculate the weighted average of energy, valence, and danceability
based on the number of plays on each song.
This approach would more accurately represent the listener's aura.
